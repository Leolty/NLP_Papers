## 2. Common data manipulation methods 

- argumentation:

  - image flipping
  - replace words with synonyms

- weighting

  - inverse class frequency (?)

  - loss values

previous work:
1. learn the composition of argumentation operations with RL
2. derive sample weights adaptively from a validation set via meta learning (?)
3. learn a weighting network by inducing a curriculum (?)

limited application scope

-> a new approach for different manipulation schemes
